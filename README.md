# Description
Essentially, the purpose of this app is to implement all of the features that I wish were in the default iPhone Alarm app. Having recently moved from android to ios, one of the things
I had immediately missed was the ability to set an alarm for a specific date not just repeat for a given day. That's how this project got started in the first place.

### Features
As I worked on this project, I began to realize just how badly designed the Alarm App was, and I implemented them in my version:
- Swiping right all the way across an Alarm deletes the alarm
- Being able to set Repeats for Weekends, Weekdays, and most importantly, Everyday
- Being able to select a specific date for the Alarm (that can be set MORE than a week in the future)
- A label option to view in the Alarm page and a description option where you can write down specific things about a given Alarm, like Location, Purpose, etc.

## UI
Designed completely by myself. Probably the largest UI/UX project I partaken in, especially having learned swiftUI in about a week just before starting this project.

## How to use
Since there's no actual way to set an alarm in IOS with the same permissions as the default app, I decided to forgo the $200 developer fee to release an alarm app that just sends you a notification.
However, if you just want to try out the UI in XCode:
1. Download the zipfile
2. Unzip the file
3. Drag the folder to XCode
4. You may need to remove the DerivedData folder in from the project and then recompile
  - You can do this by deleting the DerivedData folder in the project directory.
5. And then build, and it should all work


# Reflection and what I learned
I learned a lot making this project. This was the first phone app I ever built so I got to really know how to use XCode IDE, I got to implement and create user based UI/UX that I feel
is not as focused on in software developement. I built this project in around 2 weeks with little touch ups here and there. I believe this is a great idea and I would strongly recommend Apple
adopt some of its features.
